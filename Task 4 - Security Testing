# Test Case ID: TC_Security_004  
**Title:** Check Login Security Measures  

## Preconditions
- Use a valid test account.
- Ensure the application login page is accessible.

## Test Steps
1. Attempt to inject SQL code into the username and password fields.  
   Example: `' OR '1'='1`  
2. Try logging in with invalid credentials.  
3. Observe how the system handles and displays error messages.  
4. Verify that no database or sensitive information is exposed.  
5. Check that user passwords are stored using encryption or hashing (if accessible).

## Expected Results
- The application should prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.  
- Error messages should be generic (e.g., “Invalid credentials”) and not reveal system details.  
- User credentials should be securely stored (hashed/encrypted).  
- Login mechanism should remain secure under all tests.
