# Task 7 – Regression Testing

## Objective
To ensure that the previously working functionalities of the e-commerce website still work correctly after new updates, bug fixes, or changes.

## Scope of Regression Testing
- Login and signup functionality  
- Product search and filters  
- Add to cart  
- Checkout process  
- Payment flow  
- Order history  
- UI and responsiveness  

## Approach
1. Execute previously passed test cases  
2. Re-test fixed defects  
3. Run critical user-flow test cases  
4. Use automation if available  
5. Perform smoke test before regression cycle  

## Entry Criteria
- All new features have been tested  
- Bug fixes are completed  
- Stable build is available  

## Exit Criteria
- All regression test cases executed  
- All critical bugs closed  
- No high/medium severity defects  
- Test report prepared  

## Test Cases (Sample)
| TC ID | Test Case Description | Expected Result |
|------|------------------------|-----------------|
| RT_01 | Verify login after new UI update | User logs in successfully |
| RT_02 | Check product search after backend update | Results load correctly |
| RT_03 | Add to cart after price update | Product added successfully |
| RT_04 | Payment flow after API changes | Order completes successfully |

## Conclusion
Regression testing ensures that updates or fixes do not break existing functionalities and the system remains stable.
